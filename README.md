Description: Allows the user to upload and edit photos (raster images in JPEG, PNG, ...).
 
- image loading by drag and drop or file type input control and saving the final result
- selection implementation (initially the whole image, change with mouse down - mouse up, similar to the selection mechanism in Microsoft Paint)
- interactive crop (the user must be able to select the area in the image with the mouse)
- apply an effect chosen by the user to a selected area of the image
- aspect-preserving image scaling (user will provide new width or new length)
- add text (user provides text, size, color, position)
- display continuously (and during selection change) color histogram for the current selection
- move selection (using mouse and shift key)
- clear selection -> pixels in the selection will become white
